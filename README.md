Ouestion 2
Solves the,Write a Lottery class that simulates a lottery.
The class should have an array of five integers named lotteryNumbers.The constructor should
use the random() funtion to generate a random number in the range of 0 through 9 for each
clement in the array. The class should also have a function that accepts an array of five integers
that represent a person's lottery picks.
The method is to compare the corresponding elements in the two arrays and return the number
of digits that match.
For example, the following shows the lotteryNumbers array and the user's array with sample
numbers stored in each.
